# Scenario-6-Group-I
The code needed to use the IR proximity based Spirometer is in the file named ISpiro Final 
This code is designed for a circuit Playground Express board and is written in C++ on arduino IDE 
The code uses the in built IR transmitter and Receiver to work and as such a few ibraries are necessary 
These libraries are <Aruduino.h>, <Circuit_Playground.h> and <Proximity.h>
The proximity library can be accessed here: https://github.com/family-richards/Circuit-Playground-Express-proximity
